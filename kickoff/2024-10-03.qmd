### MUD cards: admin
- Questions about how to download HTML of lecture notes
\vspace{2ex}
    - See https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/ppha30538_fall2024 homepage to pull all lecture files, including HTML
- Questions about other github setup (e.g. forking)
\vspace{2ex}
    - See revised instructions in lecture 0
    - Also, 104 forks created as of Tuesday night so most folks are figuring it out. If you haven't yet, ask a friend
- Questions about Visual Studio Code and Quarto
\vspace{2ex}
    - Ozzy posted a recording of mini-lesson from Wednesday's lab - see Canvas. The minilesson will also be repeated in today's lab.kj
- Lab Quiz Note: The quiz will only be available during the first 10 minutes of lab.

### MUD cards: content 
- Is JSON something we'll need to write or regularly refer to?
\vspace{2ex}
    - No, it's mostly working in the background. But it's good to know how to read it since a lot of data is stored as JSON as well
- What does it mean for Vega and Vega-lite to be "grammars"?
\vspace{2ex}
    - A grammar is a formal set of rules/structure for creating visualizations, where the structure of the code specifies what the visualization represents as opposed to just telling Python how to "draw" it.
    - A grammar isn't anything specific to Python 
    - And will only come up in visualization in this course

### MUD cards
- As an aside: MUD cards have already proven to be really useful!
- Teaching team hadn't realized the quick turnaround required between teaching VSCode at Thursday lab and the Saturday problem set deadline until it was brought up in the MUD cards
- We were able to respond and put up a recording on Wednesday
- So keep them coming :)
